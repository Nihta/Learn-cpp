# Strings

## Interview Essentials

The string data type is used to represent text, and string values must be enclosed in either single or double quotation marks. Even though strings themselves are a basic data type, interviewers come up with questions that are anything but simple! Make sure that you are very familiar with string methods for your chosen interviewing language. In most languages, strings are implemented as character arrays, which means that string questions and array questions are interchangeable in a lot of cases.
